# Conditional p-Dispersion Problem

In this paper, we propose a new heuristic method that hybridizes GRASP with Path Relinking to solve the conditional p-Dispersion problem. Given n elements, from which $q < n$ have been already selected, this problem seeks to select $p < n$ additional unselected elements to maximize the minimum dissimilarity among all pairs of selected elements. The conditional p-dispersion problem models a realistic version in facility location called the maximum diversity problem, given that in many practical settings, when locating facilities some units are already located. The algorithm includes a novel proposal based on an efficient interplay between search intensification and diversification provided by the Path Relinking component that incorporates an intelligent way to measure the diversity among solutions. An extensive computational experimentation is carried out to compare the performance of the proposal with the state of the art method. As shown in the experimental section the comparison favors our proposal, which successfully identifies 17 best-known values.
